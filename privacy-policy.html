  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective date: September 26, 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>Car Scanner - AI Camera</strong> mobile application (the "Application") provided by <strong>OmarDevSolutions</strong> ("Service Provider"). The Application allows users to check vehicles by submitting images and vehicle details such as make, model, year, and engine type. The service is provided "AS IS".</p>

  <h2>Information Collection</h2>
  <p>The Application does not collect personal information such as your name, email, or location. Only vehicle-related information and images are submitted for analysis:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Vehicle make, model, year, and fuel type.</li>
    <li>Photos of vehicles or vehicle parts.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No other personal data is required or collected.</p>

  <h2>Image Processing</h2>
  <p>Images submitted through the Application are processed temporarily to detect vehicle faults or defects. Key points:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Images are transmitted securely to the analysis API.</li>
    <li>Images and analysis data are <strong>not stored permanently</strong> by the Application or API.</li>
    <li>All processing happens in real-time and is deleted immediately after analysis.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Use of Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Application uses third-party AI and vision APIs to process images. These services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not retain your personal or vehicle data beyond the processing session.</li>
    <li>Are used solely to provide the requested vehicle analysis.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider does not share images or vehicle data with third parties. Disclosure may occur only:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When required by law (e.g., subpoena).</li>
    <li>To protect the rights, safety, or security of the Service Provider or users.</li>
    <li>To trusted service providers under strict confidentiality obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>No vehicle data or images are stored permanently. Any temporary data is deleted immediately after analysis.</p>

  <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Application is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe your child has provided data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:genioweb.es@gmail.com">genioweb.es@gmail.com</a> so we can delete it immediately.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider takes reasonable measures to protect any data during processing, including encryption and secure transmission. However, no system can guarantee 100% security.</p>

  <h2>Opt-Out</h2>
  <p>You can stop using the Application at any time by uninstalling it. This will end all data processing.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the Application after updates constitutes acceptance of the changes.</p>
